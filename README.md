This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Character Deleter

This is a simple web-app that takes text input and displays it back out on the
page. The text is displayed as indivudual characters. Clicking on a character
will delete in from the input element as well as the display.
